# Description

This extension lets you connect any Isaac Sim project to the Foxglove visualization platform using the WebSocket Protocol.
All data sources are detected automatically and updated dynamically and will appear as topics on the Foxglove client's side.

# Usage

Inside Isaac Sim, open the Foxglove Extension tab by clicking on Foxglove > Foxglove Extension in the toolbar, then
follow the instructions to start publishing.

To visualize the data, you will need to open a WebSocket connection from your Foxglove Dashboard to ws://localhost:<port>.
Inside Isaac Sim, you can click on Foxglove > Open in Browser in the toolbar to directly connect to the websocket session.
