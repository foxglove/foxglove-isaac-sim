# Description

This extension lets you connect any Isaac Sim project to the Foxglove visualization platform using the WebSocket Protocol.
All data sources are detected automatically and updated dynamically and will appear as topics on the Foxglove client's side.

# Usage

Inside Isaac Sim, open the Foxglove Extension tab by clicking on Foxglove > Foxglove Extension in the toolbar. The Foxglove 
server will remain open as long as this tab is not closed.

To visualize the data, simply click on "View in Foxglove" to directly connect to the WebSocket session.
Alternatively, you can manually open a WebSocket connection from your Foxglove Dashboard to ws://localhost:[port].
